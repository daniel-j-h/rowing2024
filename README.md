# Context

In 2024 I set myself the stretch goal to row across the Atlantic: virtually on my Concept2 rowing machine.
In the end I was short by about 500 km, another 10'ish marathon distances.
But rowing almost 60 marathon distances has shown me a lot and I'm grateful that I made it that far with my limited two years of rowing experience.

I have set up this repository to track my progress.
Here is how it works and how you can do the same for your own Atlantic crossing challenge
1. There's a github action running daily scraping the Concept2 Logbook profile
2. The github action then writes the latest kilometers so far into an index.html
3. There is a github page set up to serve the index.html publicly

If you fork this repository you can have an auto-updating map tracking your Atlantic crossing challenge, too!
